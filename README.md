###Intellectual System For E-Health

##Conclusion

The E-Health app system has the potential to significantly improve the lives of its users by providing them with convenient and personalized access to a variety of healthcare services. The symptom-based disease prediction model, diabetes disease prediction model, and heart disease prediction model can help users identify potential health problems early on and get the care they need. The app also provides users with information on diet, health, exercise, first aid, emergencies, and medicine tabs. This information can help users make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

##Future Work

The app's future development will focus on improving the accuracy of prediction models, adding new features, and expanding the app's coverage. There are a number of areas where the E-Health app system can be improved in the future. One area of focus is on improving the accuracy of the prediction models. This could be done by collecting more data and using more sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Another area of focus is on developing new features for the app. For example, the app could be integrated with wearable devices to track users' health data. The app could also be used to connect users with healthcare providers for virtual consultations. E-Health App System plans to expand its features to include a personalized health plan, a medication reminder system, and a virtual doctor consultation service. These new features will further enhance the app's ability to provide users with comprehensive healthcare support. Additionally, the app will continue to utilize machine learning and AI to improve the accuracy of its prediction models and develop new features that address the evolving needs of its users.
